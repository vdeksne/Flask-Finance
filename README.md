# Flask-based web application
This repository contains a Flask-based web application that allows users to manage their stock portfolio. The application integrates with an SQLite database and supports features like buying, selling, and viewing stock transactions, as well as displaying real-time stock quotes. Users can log in securely, check their portfolio, make transactions, and track their financial history.

The app leverages the CS50 library for SQL queries and uses Flask session management for user authentication and handling. This repo is an ideal project for anyone learning web development, finance management, or Flask.
